- Added in logic for blacklists
- Filters now come in two types. Searches (items you want to see) and Blacklists.
- Blacklists are universally applied. When creating a blacklist you are able to see
    in the main window which items that filter will exclude from searches. 
- Added a confirmation dialog for deleting filters.
- Added a confirmation dialog for when you set a new favorite.
- Added a warning dialog when you attempt to set a favorited filter as a blacklist.
- Added a warning dialog when you attempt to save a new filter with the same name as
    an existing filter.
- Added a warning dialog when you check the Blacklist box on a filter without having
    the Blacklists box checked on the main window. When updating/modifying/creating
    blacklists you should have that box checked, and vice versa for Searches.
