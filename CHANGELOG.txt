20210207
- bug fixes
- Default Filter updated. Now excludes all items that aren't common, uncommon, rare, epic (white, green, blue, purple)
- Item Blacklist Added
    - Items are blacklisted based on their itemid, item level, and quality.
    - Shadowlands Legendaries are filtered by their names due to how they are handled with bonus ids
- Updated the logic for filtering items to have better short circuiting logic (should improve speed).
- Added list for item id's that should be filtered out by default. Currently only lists the boards for the mechagon trinket

20210204
- Added in logic for blacklists
- Filters now come in two types. Searches (items you want to see) and Blacklists.
- Blacklists are universally applied. When creating a blacklist you are able to see
    in the main window which items that filter will exclude from searches. 
- Added a confirmation dialog for deleting filters.
- Added a confirmation dialog for when you set a new favorite.
- Added a warning dialog when you attempt to set a favorited filter as a blacklist.
- Added a warning dialog when you attempt to save a new filter with the same name as
    an existing filter.
- Added a warning dialog when you check the Blacklist box on a filter without having
    the Blacklists box checked on the main window. When updating/modifying/creating
    blacklists you should have that box checked, and vice versa for Searches.
- Fixed bug where Disenchant button wasn't reenabled if Disenchant was interrupted.
- More code cleanup
- Some cleanup of the frames.
